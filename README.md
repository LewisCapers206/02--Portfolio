# 02--Portfolio

This project was interesting, it gave me a chance to put the skills that I learned to the test. It is a porfolio about me and my future work that I will be doing.
I was able to learn a lot about the flexbox properties and what they can really do. There was a couple 
things that stumped me a few times. Such as getting my nav bar centered the way I wanted it to and how
it fit with the header.

I felt as though I could have consollidated my CSS file better, and that is something that I can continue to work on.
If I make similar classes in the HTML and apply those in the CSS I feel as though I can clean up my CSS some more.

I built this project so that I can use it in the future as an acual portfolio for myself. I will continue to use the skills that I learn in order to make it better and much more clean.

Some of the technologies I used were HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap
